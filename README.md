This repository showcases different python projects I have done during my studies.

## yatzy-game
A complete yatzy game written in Python. The code is written in finnish.
- The game works on command-line interface
- Writes and reads data from a file

## Structure factor calculation
An analysis tool used to compute structure factor from a data obtained from cp2k ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.
Developed during a summer internship.
- Performs preprocessing on the data
- Uses numba to speed up calculation
- Compares simulation data to experimental data and visualizes the results.

## Image classification
An image classification project. Images are read from urls and preprocessed for an alaysis.
- Ten features that capture color and texture information are extracted from the images
- Data is visualized using pairplot, histogram and PCA.
- Ridge, Random Forest and MLP classifiers were trained and evaluated to classify the images
