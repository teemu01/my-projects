This repository showcases different python projects I have done during my studies.

# yatzy-game
A complete yatzy game written in Python. The code is written in finnish.
-The game works on command-line interface
-Writes and reads data from a file

# Structure factor calculation
An analysis tool used to compute structure factor from a data obtained from cp2k ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.
Developed during a summer internship.
-Performs preprocessing on the data
-Uses numba to speed up calculation
-Compares simulation data to experimental data and visualizes the results.
